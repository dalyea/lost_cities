Reinforcement Learning For Lost Cities

This project used tensorflow in python in order to build an actor-critic DQN to play a reduced size version of Lost Cities.
When successful, it will be scaled up to create a playing agent for the full Lost Cities game with 60 cards.

I'm seeking individuals who would like to collaborate on this project.
